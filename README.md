<b>Hello, my name is Keaton Moyer and welcome to my portfolio!</b>
</p>



# About Me

I am a graduate from The Pennsylvania State University with a Bachelor of Science in mathematics and minor in statistics. I am from Fleetwood, PA. I am an active member with several organizations within my community. I am an avid sports fan and enjoy analyzing soccer and baseball data. I am currently working on several projects, which I will upload as soon as I complete them.

# Computer Programming

I am proficient in R, Minitab, and Microsoft Office, with experience in Python, SQL, C++, and SAS.

# Portfolio

I have a passion for taking data and visualizing it. For a class project, I took English Premier League data dating back to 1888 to 2016. I wanted to visualize the data using Leaflet in order to show a possible contrast in success based on geography.

In my spare time, I enjoy Star Wars and discovered Henry M Bernbergâ€™s Star Wars Galaxy Map online. He had datasets available. I decided I wanted to try and replicate it myself using R. This is my final result:
