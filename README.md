Hi, my name is Keaton Moyer and welcome to my portfolio!

# About Me

I am a recent graduate from The Pennsylvania State University with a Bachelor of Science in mathematics and minor in statistics. I am from Fleetwood, PA. I am an active member in my community volunteering with the Fleetwood Neighborhood Watch and the Fleetwood Days Carnival. I am an avid sports fan and enjoy analyzing soccer and baseball data. I am currently working on several projects, which I will upload as soon as I finish them.

# Portfolio

I have a passion for taking data and visualizing it. For a class project, I took English Premier League data dating back to 1888 to 2016. I wanted to visualize the data using Leaflet in order to show a possible contrast in success based on geography.

In my spare time, I enjoy Star Wars and discovered Henry M Bernbergâ€™s Star Wars Galaxy Map online. He had datasets available. I decided I wanted to try and replicate it myself using R. This is my final result:
